# eskeleto

This provides a skeleton for a basic web app built in HTML, CSS, and ES/JS.

As I think static typing adds great communication and planning value, I use
TypeScript here rather than raw JS.
I use TS rather than Flow because it seems to have better traction, had cross
platform (Windows support) sooner, seems to have more of the feature set I want,
has more IDE support, and also eats its own dog food.
This isn't to say I've done a full comparison between TS and Flow, but I'm quite
happy with the TS experience these days.
Still, I'd like to see TS allow '.js' extensions, and I'd like to see typing
syntax (and perhaps even semantics) in the ECMAScript standard.
I don't feel a need to treat TS as a different language from ES.
Maybe someday.

Also, I have comments in the skeleton files here, mostly explaining why things
are organized as they are.
When using this skeleton in a new project, feel free to delete such
explanations.
Some of them might just be noise if carried beyond here.
